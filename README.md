#G2_Skin_Tweaks

Provides some simple tweaks to the stock LG G2 skin.

 - Change the out-of-place (imo) Switch (see Settings for reference) to a CheckBox
 - A square bubble for the Messenger app
 - Hopefully more to come...

I gladly take request, though I'm very new to the Android programming so I might not be capable.
